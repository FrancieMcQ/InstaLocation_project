202,New York,1,1,";Welcome to my channel!!

Many know me as a meteorologist in NYC. I actually took a break from my full-time weather anchor gig to spend more time with my family. But, you can still catch me filling in on occasion for News 12 Networks in New York. 

When I’m not chasing storms and running after my two children, you can find me blogging about my multiracial family, natural hair care, career and amazing recipes at weatheranchormama.com. This channel has become an extension of my blog. So be sure to subscribe to my channel to watch more of my biracial family, mixed hair care tutorials, and more.

Women can get their hair blown out and styled by great stylists without having to compete with clients getting their hair cut and colored. Blow Dry Bar makes coming in for a blow out as easy and affordable as a weekly mani/pedi.
 
We use high quality products that are individualized for clients’ needs and goals with a focus on using shampoo and conditioners that improve the hair’s health as well as styling products that are non-damaging to the hair and enhance the longevity of the blow out.

About our owner: 

Rebecca Tallarine is a native Houstonian, experienced salon professional, and enthusiastic entrepreneur.
 
Rebecca began her career in the salon/spa industry in 2001 while attending the University of Texas. After graduating, she worked in a salon/spa full-time until opening her own spa business in Austin in 2005.
 
After the birth of her baby girl in 2008, Rebecca came home to Houston to be close to family. Her desire to return to the salon/spa industry she loved inspired a luxurious new salon concept, and the idea for Blow Dry Bar was born. Rebecca’s mission is to provide Houston’s fabulous, busy women with a place to get great hair for less and in less time.

👇New Blog Post👇 website: http://www.looksbymc.com/;The Haute Project started as a channel, by my sisters and I, as a creative outlet to share fashion, beauty, and lifestyle content. The channel featured lookbooks, outfit inspirations, style tips, make up and skincare reviews, travel vlogs, DIY's, life tips & chats. Over the years, more than just informative content we aimed to curate positivity, joy, and inspiration. Today, The Haute Project is continued by Mai Nou, writer & blogger at looksbymc.com. 
While the channel still aims to fuel positivity and joy, the channel will focus on fashion and the fashion industry content to inspire and empower women. 
We want to thank you our subbies for being with us from day one. To our new subbies, welcome!

454,American,1,1,";Michael Hainey had just turned six when his uncle knocked on his family’s back door one morning with the tragic news: Bob Hainey, Michael’s father, was found alone near his car on Chicago’s North Side, dead, of an apparent heart attack. Thirty-five years old, a young assistant copy desk chief at the Chicago Sun-Times, Bob was a bright and shining star in the competitive, hard-living world of newspapers, one that involved booze-soaked nights that bled into dawn. And then suddenly he was gone, leaving behind a young widow, two sons, a fractured family—and questions surrounding the mysterious nature of his death that would obsess Michael throughout adolescence and long into adulthood. Finally, roughly his father’s age when he died, and a seasoned reporter himself, Michael set out to learn what happened that night. Died “after visiting friends,” the obituaries said. But the details beyond that were inconsistent. What friends? Where? At the heart of his quest is Michael’s all-too-silent, opaque mother, a woman of great courage and tenacity—and a steely determination not to look back. Prodding and cajoling his relatives, and working through a network of his father’s buddies who abide by an honor code of silence and secrecy, Michael sees beyond the long-held myths and ultimately reconciles the father he’d imagined with the one he comes to know—and in the journey discovers new truths about his mother.

A stirring portrait of a family and its legacy of secrets, After Visiting Friends is the story of a son who goes in search of the truth and finds not only his father, but a rare window into a world of men and newspapers and fierce loyalties that no longer exists.

“A beautifully written exploration of family bonds and the secrets that may test them.” (Vanessa Bush Booklist )

“Hainey’s writing is balletic, nimbly avoiding both sentimentality and sensationalism, making grief and absence into powerful and fully felt forces. His short scenes appear like flashes of memory, prose poems of what once was, and he skillfully weaves a narrative that transcends his own and spans generations...Part elegy, part mystery and wholly unforgettable.” (Kirkus Reviews (starred review) )

“Since the age of six, Michael Hainey had been haunted by the mysterious death of his father, a Chicago newspaperman. In After Visiting Friends he recounts in moving detail the obstacles he faced in uncovering the truth.” (Elissa Schappell Vanity Fair )

""Michael Hainey makes his quest for answers about his father read like a thriller. Then, just when he’s got you turning pages as fast as you can, he stops you with a heartrending detail, or steers you into some drowsy gin mill or fading prairie town for a sidebar of blunt-force power. By the end you’re wrung out, but also uplifted."" (J.R. Moehringer, author of Sutton and The Tender Bar )

""As much an elegy to a once-upon-a-time era in American newspapers as it is a journey back, into a family and its past, to find truth. With poetic grace and taut investigative storytelling, Michael Hainey's After Visiting Friends shows how to keep going we sometimes need to pause and look back at where and who we come from."" (Nick Flynn, auhor of The Reenactments )

“Is there any more powerful story in the world than a boy looking for his father? Michael Hainey's memoir begins with a mysterious death, proceeds through years of unanswered questions, builds into a relentless investigation, and ends with the stubborn alchemy of a heart transformed. This is a beautiful work of reporting and redemption. Parts of this story will stay with me forever. I finished it in tears."" (Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love and Committed )

“Michael Hainey's After Visiting Friends is my sort of book, a Chicago book, a family book of secrets. The powerful mystery at the heart of this story will pull you through to the moving ending, but its Hainey's straightforward and harrowing honesty that will grip you and stay with you. There's great dignity in the way Hainey treats his people, and this lost story.” (Peter Orner, author of Love and Shame and Love )

“Michael Hainey is a great writer. His memoir, After Visiting Friends, is not only gripping and powerful, but it is impeccably written. With a deft hand and a gentle touch, memoir becomes mystery in a world that brings back a bygone era of newspapermen. Hainey takes us through a deeply poignant journey of self-discovery—about how hard it is to sort out who we are and why we are and how our searches can lead to the most unexpected, but most satisfying, discoveries.” (David Sheff, author of Beautiful Boy )

“I inhaled this story. Everything you want and need in a book. I started chapter one with my coffee in the morning and then never made it to work. A beautiful book.” (Gabrielle Hamilton, author of Blood, Bones & Butter )

""A book whose heartbreak and humor, in the true Irish tradition, can't be untangled. It's a kind of detective story, but the mystery is the past itself."" (John Jeremiah Sullivan, author of Pulphead )

Michael Hainey's memoir begins with a mysterious death, proceeds through years of unanswered questions, builds into a relentless investigation, and ends with the stubborn alchemy of a heart transformed. This is a beautiful work of reporting and redemption. Parts of this story will stay with me forever. I finished it in tears."" (Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love and Committed )

“Michael Hainey's After Visiting Friends is my sort of book, a Chicago book, a family book of secrets. The powerful mystery at the heart of this story will pull you through to the moving ending, but its Hainey's straightforward and harrowing honesty that will grip you and stay with you. There's great dignity in the way Hainey treats his people, and this lost story.” (Peter Orner, author of Love and Shame and Love )

“Michael Hainey is a great writer. His memoir, After Visiting Friends, is not only gripping and powerful, but it is impeccably written. With a deft hand and a gentle touch, memoir becomes mystery in a world that brings back a bygone era of newspapermen. Hainey takes us through a deeply poignant journey of self-discovery—about how hard it is to sort out who we are and why we are and how our searches can lead to the most unexpected, but most satisfying, discoveries.” (David Sheff, author of Beautiful Boy )

“I inhaled this story. Everything you want and need in a book. I started chapter one with my coffee in the morning and then never made it to work. A beautiful book.” (Gabrielle Hamilton, author of Blood, Bones & Butter )

""A book whose heartbreak and humor, in the true Irish tradition, can't be untangled. It's a kind of detective story, but the mystery is the past itself."" (John Jeremiah Sullivan, author of Pulphead )

960,Australia,1,1,";On Sunday September 24th 2017, tens of thousands of distinguished gentlefolk in hundreds of cities worldwide will don their cravats, tweak their moustaches, press their tweed and sit astride their classic and vintage styled motorcycles to raise funds and awareness for men’s health, specifically prostate cancer research and suicide prevention.

The Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride was founded in Sydney, Australia by Mark Hawwa. It was inspired by a photo of Mad Men’s Don Draper astride a classic bike and wearing his finest suit. Mark decided a themed ride would be a great way to combat the often negative stereotype of men on motorcycles, whilst connecting niche motorcycle communities together.

That first ride in 2012 brought together over 2,500 riders across 64 cities. The success of the event encouraged the founder to consider how it could be used to support a worthy cause.

• In 2013, over 11,000 participants in 145 cities around the world raised over $277k (US) for
prostate cancer research.

• In 2014, over 20,000 participants in 257 cities in 58 countries raised over $1.5M (US) for
prostate cancer research.

• In 2015, over 37,000 participants in 410 cities in 79 countries raised over $2.3M (US) for
prostate cancer research.

•In 2016, more than 57,000 participants in 505 cities from 90 countries mounted their motorcycles to raise awareness and $3.65M (US) to help fund research into prostate cancer and support male suicide prevention on behalf of The Movember Foundation

Influenced by the tragedy of losing one of our ride hosts to depression, 2016 saw a change in our health goals. Now, the funding of suicide prevention programs is a DGR focus, in addition to prostate cancer research through our new official charity partner The Movember Foundation and the support of our title sponsors Triumph Motorcycles and Zenith Watches.

The Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride is a celebration of the art of being dapper and classic custom motorcycles.

What does that mean, you ask?

Think: Monocles, jaunty trimmed moustaches, silk vests, crisp shirts and tailored suits.

Ride: Cafe' Racer, Bobber, Classic, Tracker, Scrambler, Old School Chopper, Modern Classic, Sidecar, Classic Scooter, Brat Styled motorcycles. Visit our style guide to check out the bikes that make The Distinguished Gentleman’s the unique event that it is. http://www.gentlemansride.com/about/style-guide

961,Sydney,1,1,";On Sunday September 24th 2017, tens of thousands of distinguished gentlefolk in hundreds of cities worldwide will don their cravats, tweak their moustaches, press their tweed and sit astride their classic and vintage styled motorcycles to raise funds and awareness for men’s health, specifically prostate cancer research and suicide prevention.

The Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride was founded in Sydney, Australia by Mark Hawwa. It was inspired by a photo of Mad Men’s Don Draper astride a classic bike and wearing his finest suit. Mark decided a themed ride would be a great way to combat the often negative stereotype of men on motorcycles, whilst connecting niche motorcycle communities together.

That first ride in 2012 brought together over 2,500 riders across 64 cities. The success of the event encouraged the founder to consider how it could be used to support a worthy cause.

• In 2013, over 11,000 participants in 145 cities around the world raised over $277k (US) for
prostate cancer research.

• In 2014, over 20,000 participants in 257 cities in 58 countries raised over $1.5M (US) for
prostate cancer research.

• In 2015, over 37,000 participants in 410 cities in 79 countries raised over $2.3M (US) for
prostate cancer research.

•In 2016, more than 57,000 participants in 505 cities from 90 countries mounted their motorcycles to raise awareness and $3.65M (US) to help fund research into prostate cancer and support male suicide prevention on behalf of The Movember Foundation

Influenced by the tragedy of losing one of our ride hosts to depression, 2016 saw a change in our health goals. Now, the funding of suicide prevention programs is a DGR focus, in addition to prostate cancer research through our new official charity partner The Movember Foundation and the support of our title sponsors Triumph Motorcycles and Zenith Watches.

The Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride is a celebration of the art of being dapper and classic custom motorcycles.

What does that mean, you ask?

Think: Monocles, jaunty trimmed moustaches, silk vests, crisp shirts and tailored suits.

Ride: Cafe' Racer, Bobber, Classic, Tracker, Scrambler, Old School Chopper, Modern Classic, Sidecar, Classic Scooter, Brat Styled motorcycles. Visit our style guide to check out the bikes that make The Distinguished Gentleman’s the unique event that it is. http://www.gentlemansride.com/about/style-guide

Do: Bring your finest manners, neatest facial foliage, a sense of fun and a smile.

Pay: The ride is free however we encourage those riding to make a donation to the cause as well as consider helping reach our fundraising goals by getting friends, family and colleagues to donate via your personal fundraising page.

I mostly write reviews about restaurants in Dublin and post articles about foodie events, travels, lifestyle and more. I also share French recipes and French insights from time to time.

In December 2012 French Foodie in Dublin won Best Expat Blog in Ireland.

In August 2013 I started running French Food and Wine Tours of Dublin. The tours offer participants the chance to experience a unique take on Dublin from my French perspective through visiting some of the best spots for French food and wine in the city centre.

1223,Madrid,1,1,";Me llamo Eva Verdeal, estudie diseño de moda entre Madrid y Londres. Profesión que me encanta  y de hecho me he dedicado y trabajado  siempre en el mundo de la moda,  hasta que tuve niños… Con el nacimiento de mis hijos me vi un poco condicionada al intentar conciliar la   vida laboral con la familiar, tengo  tres niños. Y ya sabéis la falta de tiempo me hizo plantearme qué hacer con mi vida laboral.  
 La cosa es que desde hace un tiempo me rondaba por la cabeza montar mi propia empresa,  no tenía claro el cómo ni el que. .. y después de muchas vueltas me que decidí .”   La idea surgió, al intentar unir el mundo de los niños, la moda, la personalización y la facilidad que ahora nos da internet,  y con un poco de gracia y esmero monté  “Dime que me quieres”. 
 Poder personalizar como tú quieras tus collares, pulseras, toallas, delantales… Es una manera diferente de decir  “te quiero” a la gente que te rodea,  a tus hijos, padres, parejas, amigos… haciendo de algo sencillo algo también muy especial y exclusivo.  
 Os diré que no todo es personalizado, porque  como ya sabéis la cabra tira al monte… y algo de creatividad de diseñadora de moda  también  hay, algo retro, algo dulce, algo de mí, lo que me gusta  y me inspira es lo que hago. Espero que os guste!!

hola, soy neus
Madre, empresaría, formadora, blogger, apasionada del interiorismo y del color. la esencia de mi trabajo es ofrecerte ideas, workshops, tutoriales y productos decorativos para ayudarte a que tú misma puedas crear el alma de tu hogar.

www.creadecorarecicla.com

los detalles de mi historia
•	Mí maternidad lo cambio todo, me hizo frenar en mi carrera profesional para reencontrarme y conectarme con mi lado más creativo. La magia de crear un ser vivo dentro de mí me reveló la gran creatividad que las mujeres albergamos dentro. Somos creativas por naturaleza ¿no te parece?
•	En el 2010 decidí crear mi blog, esta idea surgió de forma espontánea y totalmente altruista, mi único objetivo fue el de compartir con personas afines proyectos decorativos fáciles de llevar a cabo. Fue sorprendente que llegaran miles de lectores al blog.
•	Un buen día decidí diseñar un workshop creativo y la acogida y demanda fueron sorprendentes para mí. Decidí escuchar a las personas que me escribían y organicé talleres en diferentes ciudades del país a la vez que abría una pequeña tienda on-line.
•	Poco tiempo después  descubrí la Chalk Paint, pintura natural totalmente alineada a mi marca, a mis proyectos y a mis clientes. Crea Decora Recicla fue el primer blog del país en hablar de Chalk Paint, en difundir esta fantástica pintura y sus workshops. 
•	En el 2013 la marca Autentico®Paint me propuso distribuir sus pinturas naturales en España y Portugal. Acepté la propuesta, me pareció muy interesante introducir con fuerza la pintura natural de alta calidad y conseguí gracias a mis clientes posicionar la marca Autentico® y su línea de chalk Paint (pintura a la tiza) como referente en el país. 
•	Soy una gran afortunada por haber visto pasar por mis workshops a centenares de personas, algunas de ellas incluso de otros países. Hay pocas cosas que me den la energía de compartir lo aprendido estos años con personas entusiastas y creativas.
•	En los últimos años Crea Decora Recicla ha crecido paulatinamente y ya no estoy sola en este proyecto, ahora somos un equipo de personas apasionadas y entregados al color y a nuestros clientes.
•	En mi aventura, mi norte, siempre ha sido y será satisfacer a mis clientes y ello es posible cuando te rodeas de productos de alta calidad y de un equipo diez.

Goiko Grill nace en un pequeño local con apenas 30 sillas. Era el sueño de Andoni, un médico que venía de Caracas para ejercer de residente (MIR) en el Hospital de La Paz y que acabó colgando la bata para enfundarse el delantal.

Al principio no entraba ni Dios, pero paso a paso, sus hamburguesas comenzaron a conquistar la ciudad. El sabor y el ambiente del local hizo que se corriera la voz y al poco tiempo comenzaron las colas en la puerta del local para probar las deliciosas hamburguesas.

Desde entonces se ha reinvertido todo el esfuerzo pensando en crecer y mejorar, eso sí bajo los mismos valores: calidad (la mejor hamburguesa y atención), eficiencia y buen rollo. El buen ambiente que ha marcado el crecimiento de la familia Goiko Grill.;AMAMOS lo que hacemos, hacemos 🍔🍔🍔

In 2001, I moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue acting, but was soon drawn more and more to the makeup industry. My path crossed with Tina Earnshaw, an Oscar nominated makeup for Titanic & Shakespeare in Love. I spent a summer training with her in basic makeup, beauty, runway & eventually period makeup learning to replicate looks from the 1920's, 1930's, 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. I spent my time doing makeup for headshots, small indepedent films & working for Sephora before returning to Fort Worth in 2004. I worked for Neiman Marcus in Fort Worth for 3 years and am now a freelance artist focusing on bridal and event makeup.

I am also an Independent Consultant for Rodan + Fields. These products are completely amazing, changing the look of your skin & ultimately the way your makeup looks & how much you have to apply. Four amazing regimens with a 60 days money back guarantee. You win.

I spent a summer training with her in basic makeup, beauty, runway & eventually period makeup learning to replicate looks from the 1920's, 1930's, 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. I spent my time doing makeup for headshots, small indepedent films & working for Sephora before returning to Fort Worth in 2004. I worked for Neiman Marcus in Fort Worth for 3 years and am now a freelance artist focusing on bridal and event makeup.

I am also an Independent Consultant for Rodan + Fields. These products are completely amazing, changing the look of your skin & ultimately the way your makeup looks & how much you have to apply. Four amazing regimens with a 60 days money back guarantee. You win.
Join my team & let me help your grow your business. You are your boss. You make your hours. Clinical grade skincare created by Dr. Katie Rodan & Dr. Kathy Fields that puts it's money where it's mouth is.

I've been making beauty videos here on YouTube for over 6 years. I first started my channel to teach friends how I did my makeup, since everyone would ask at school and online! After that, beauty turned into a huge passion of mine. I even went to school at FIDM for Beauty Industry Merchandising and Marketing. I hope to work in New York City in the near future and help create new beauty products for a top brand. I'm a lover of lipstick, cappuccino, and the color orange.

1524,CA,1,1,";Hello my name is Claudia, I was born in Mexico and came to the San Fernando Valley at the age of 3. I went back to Mexico with my family at the age of 6 but my parents decided it wasn’t the life they wanted for myself and my soon to be baby sister. I spent the rest of my childhood in Los Angeles. I went on to college and looked to get a Degree in Liberal Studies and Child Development for Kids with Special Needs. I married my high school sweetheart at the age of 25 and we have been married for 5 years now and now have our son Kai Alessandro.
 
I started a bi-lingual fashion blog in 2013 to express myself through fashion, beauty and lifestyle, and show everyone that you don’t need waste all your money on expensive things. All you need is a little inspiration and creativity, and a whole lot of confidence. My blog has opened up great opportunities for me and allowed me to expand in more ways than I imagined. Everything on the blog is about being realistic with the amount of money we spend on our clothes and beauty products. I love to find the best deals out there for myself and my followers so we can all be able to showcase how it is possible to be fashionable on a Budget.;Lifestyle · Fashion · Beauty

It gave her great opportunity to be around designers, artists, musicians and other interesting like-minded personalities. After relocating to United States starting a blog and becoming an American blogger was a no-brainer to her and funny incident that happened a while ago in Spain helped to come up with the name.

…Once upon a time in Barcelona 😉 she lost her leather jacket. To finish her outfit she had to look for something else and just in 20 minutes had bought this coat. To cheer her up, friends decided to make a joke and hide her newly purchased coat…

1696,UK,1,1,";Revlon was founded in 1932, by Charles Revson and his brother Joseph, along with a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the ""L"" in the REVLON name. Starting with a single product - a nail enamel unlike any before it - the three founders pooled their meager resources and developed a unique manufacturing process.

 

Revlon is today a global leader in cosmetics, hair color, fragrances, skincare and beauty care products. One of the strongest consumer brand franchises in the world, Revlon’s products are sold in over 100 countries across six continents.

 

As a leading cosmetics brand, Revlon revitalized the industry over the years with iconic nail and lip colors and with breakthrough technology like ColorStay transfer-resistant lipstick and makeup.

 

Revlon does not conduct animal testing and has not done so since 1989.  We comprehensively test all of our products using the most technologically advanced methods available to ensure they are both innovative and safe to use.  We believe that women should have the opportunity to express themselves through makeup, so we sell our products in many markets around the world and as such, are subject to local rules and regulations.  Regulatory authorities in a few countries conduct independent testing in order to satisfy their own mandatory registration requirements. Revlon complies with all regulations in the countries in which our products are sold, and supports the advancement of non-animal testing alternatives and methodologies in our industry.;Tag us in your pics with #revlon, we'll show you some love! ❤️

1698,American,1,1,";Continually pushing the boundaries of style with her juxtaposition of classicism and modernity, Carolina Herrera has resided at the helm of her eponymous label for decades of fervent acclaim. Proving with each new season that sensibility paired in tandem with femininity and a concentration on all things contemporary, Herrera has outfitted women worldwide with an aesthetic all her own.
 
With the endorsement of legendary Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, she presented her first capsule at the Metropolitan Club, which at the time was as New York iconic as Herrera herself has now become.  Paralleling the identities of Manhattan’s chicest, Herrera’s collection was well received both commercially and editorially and thus her fashion house was born over thirty years ago.
 
“For me it’s always been about New York.  It’s where fashion begins and ends.  It is who we are.”
 
Opening her atelier shortly after her inaugural show, cultivating a couture team with the finest of training and pedigree, Herrera built an empire, consequently aligning her name synonymously with New York City and all things luxury.  Forever concluding her ready to wear shows with a wedding gown, Herrera introduced her bridal line in 1987.  Approaching bridal collections with the diversity and progressive style innate in her ready to wear collections, Herrera cornered the market for brides in search of a more fashion conscious offering. 
 
Finding resonance on the runway, down the aisle and in the pages of fashion magazines, Herrera soon found a new home on the red carpet, dressing stars both on the rise and Hollywood iconic. 
 
With her ready to wear and bridal collections firmly in place, she launched her first fragrance, Carolina Herrera Eau de Parfum, and has since released 10 additional fragrances for both men and women. 
 
Hailed as “Fashions First Lady”, Herrera was named the CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year in 2004 and honored with the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.  Acting as a mentor and critic to graduating design students for years, Herrera recently received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the Fashion Institute of Technology.  Herrera has also served as an ambassador for the American Cancer Society and the Intergovernmental Institution in the fight against malnutrition.
 
With both a global focus and an adoration for the sum of all things beautiful, she is Carolina Herrera.

Sick of greenwashed and conventional skincare products leeching their nasty toxins into skin, I decided to formulate my own products using the best quality ingredients that I could find. And I mean potent and food-grade ingredients, and I load them into each formula.

Stark products are created WITHOUT the toxic fillers, nasty preservatives, parabens, phthalates and sketchy ""fragrances"" that other companies use to cut costs and increase their profit margins. Have you ever read the ingredients on some of your skin and hair care products? There's some seriously messed up stuff in there. Don't take my word for it...check out http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com.

Stark products are all the good, none of the bad. Not a single ingredient that I use is considered harmful. What's the point of that?
 
I guess I'm a little vain so I know that good packaging matters. I make sure my products look great. Most Stark items are packaged in gorgeous glass containers which can be recycled, or better still, reused. However, just like you and I, the best stuff is still on the inside.;▫️ (actually) all natural + vegan elixirs for skin, hair and scent.

1742,American,1,1,";Roy Halston Frowick was the creator of luxury American fashion, whose groundbreaking designs still influence and inspire Fashion today.

Founded in the 1960s, the Halston label took the fashion industry by storm. Known for his innovation in millinery, Halston used his signature materials of jersey, cashmere, and suede to reinvent the jumpsuit, the shirtdress, and the classic caftan, permanently leaving his mark on fashion. 

The 1970s and the era of Studio 54 became synonymous with Halston’s designs. Soon after, he was named “the premier fashion designer in America” by Newsweek. His strong connection to pop culture was evident by his friends and clients, which included Andy Warhol, Bianca Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor, and Anjelica Huston. Halston went on to create one of the best-selling fragrances of all time in his signature tear-drop shaped perfume bottle designed by Elsa Peretti.

Halston created strong codes that are quintessential to the brand even to this day. His legacy lives on as a new team of innovators continue to evolve the HALSTON brand.

1753,Paris,1,1,";KILIAN is a fragrance brand created by Kilian Hennessy. When launching his brand, Kilian’s goal was to put perfumery back on its pedestal and return it to its former glory, the way perfumery existed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While maintaining this sense of eternity, it was also very important for Kilian to add a contemporary twist. As the Kilian brand evolves and matures, the one aspect which remains consistent is that each and every product created embodies ultimate sophistication and timeless luxury.

My name is CHRISTINE. I made this channel so I can view and interact with my favourite youtubers :) I won't be uploading any videos here, only for viewing purposes. ♥

♥ Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So love the people that treat you right and forget about the ones that don't. Believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said it'd be easy, they just promised it'd be worth it.;See what Christine Uy (chriissydollxo) has discovered on Pinterest, the world's biggest collection of everybody's favorite things.;📷 Shutterbug

1981,None,1,1,";  Закончив отделение хореографии в Академии искусств, основатель марки Белла Потемкина мечтала о балетной карьере. Но появление семьи и детей изменило направление деятельности танцовщицы.
 
     Ее новая профессия родилась из глубин души, в которых не растворилась тяга к благородству, изящным движениям воздушных балерин и бесконечной женственности. Созданные платья дышали всем тем, чем не смог стать для Беллы балет.
   
   Вдохновляясь прекрасными женщинами вокруг, рождались исключительно нежные коллекции. Юбки с ангелами на шелке, роскошные садовые цветы на льне, белые кружевные воротнички и манжеты — немного ретро, немного шика, благородство и прикрытая сексуальность — вот основа коктейля под названием Bella Potemkina.  ;TOP FASHION DESIGNER 🎉 Бутик и Салон Красоты Bella Potemkina 🎉 Модный Сезон , ресепшн +79160277172 📲доставка в города +79169671717🌎🎁👑 website: http://www.bellapotemkina.com/catalog/summer-sale/;Вдохновляясь прекрасными женщинами вокруг, рождались исключительно нежные коллекции.
